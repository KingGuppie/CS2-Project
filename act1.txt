Wow congrats you typed cat and entered act 1
Act uno 
Notes:
	I think it would be good to have Owen has a 90 minute timer (an int variable) that subtracts with each option,
	if he finsihes with enough minutes upon reachign Chutulu then he makes it to class if not then he's late
	
Introduction

Owen awokeand crawled out of bed, it was 7:00, he had 90 minutes to get to class. 
Owen has time to either get breakfast or go for a short run before getting ready for school, which does he do?
(each will give him a benefit later on)

If breakfast
	Owen sluggishly makes his way downstairs to the kitchen, what does he have for breakfast? 
	A bagel(quick and easy) or bacon and eggs and a waffle (takes longer but will wake him up)
		if Bagel 
			Owen has a yummy bagel, (-15 minutes) 
			continue to getting ready
		
		if bacon and eggs
			Owen eats Bacon and eggs and a waffle and feels super reinvigorated ! (-35 minutes and a strength bonus for boss fight)
			continue to getting ready

			
if run 
	Owen puts on his track suit and sneakers and heads out the door! does he go for a long run or a short one? 
	if short (-10 ten minutes and a speed boost for boss fight)
		Owen runs around the block and feels super awake! 
		continue to getting ready 
	
	if long (-30 minutes, will be tired for boss fight) 
		Owen goes for a nice long run and is now very tired
		continue to getting ready 
    
  getting ready 
    Owen goes back to his room, takes a shower and gets dressed, what shoes he put on? 
    Boots? flip-flops? or sneakers?

    if flip-flops (will fall if he tries to run away from Cthulhu, maybe be able to throw them?)
    if boots (no affect)
    if sneakers (he can run faster)
